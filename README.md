# 🛒 E-commerce Web Automation Project

This project is a test automation framework developed to test a sample e-commerce platform using Selenium WebDriver with Python, following a Hybrid Framework approach. It demonstrates the use of PyTest, Page Object Model (POM), reusable test components, and generates rich Allure reports for test results.
